# Final Project For SWE-861 - Software Construction

## Adulting Game App
This is the name that I used for SWE-861 Final Project, if this game gets deployed to iOS/Android devices through their respective app stores, the name for the app is as follows:

## M.E.M.E.D. - Minimal Effort, Maximum Existential Dread

M.E.M.E.D. is a mobile game that humorously gamifies real-life millennial struggles, making everyday tasks engaging and fun. It provides an interactive experience where players complete adulting challenges, earn XP, and encounter random life events.

## Project Overview

## Features

- **Daily & Recurring Tasks:** Players complete realistic adulting tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and paying bills.
- **XP & Level System:** Earn XP for completing tasks and progress through different adulting levels.
- **Energy Management:** Tasks consume energy, and players must balance their resources.
- **Random Life Events:** Unpredictable scenarios that impact time, energy, and XP.
- **Offline-First Experience:** Uses AsyncStorage for local game progress.
- **90s-Themed UI:** Nostalgic design inspired by the aesthetics of the 90s.
